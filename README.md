# MovieManiax

MovieManiax is a movie database application that allows users to search for movies and view information about them. It is built using php and mysql.

## Improvements

I already started migrating the application to use mvc and oop. I will be adding more features to the application as I finish my Laravel and Node projects.
I had not much time to code using oop and mvc, due to my work and the deadline I have to meet for my Laravel and Node projects.

## Personal goals with this project

I was focusing much more in the backend, so the frontend is not that great, but it is still functional.  
I tried to focus on the backend and the functionality of the application.

In this page is possible to see who rated the movie and who reviewed it.
For some reason Youtube stopped allowing me to share the video in my application.
